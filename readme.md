# ðŸŽ¯ Ray Tracing in One Weekend â€“ C++ Implementation

This is my personal implementation of [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley, written in modern C++ and developed entirely using **Neovim**.

The goal: learn ray tracing fundamentals, sharpen C++ skills, and get fluent with Neovim.
